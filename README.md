***************************************************************TRANSITION COMPUTING BACKEND ASSIGNMENT************************************************************************************
In this project I have made the api`s for Login,Logout,Register,user authentication and authorization using the jsonwebtoken.I used Mongodb database to store the data of registered users

API-URL : https://transition-computing-backend-assignment.onrender.com/api/v1/register Method:POST User Registeration : while user registeration the user has to give input of name,email,password,but in schema I have mentioned the role key an by default it is "user". ----The email is verified by providing some string to validate,if email is invalid it gives an error message of invalid email "please provide valid email" ----Before storing the user data into the database, I have filtered weather the eamil is exist in the database or not.If email is present in database it gives the message "Email alredy exist pls login" ---The password is hashed using the bcrypt and the password is saved securly.
