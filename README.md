In this project I have made the api`s for Login,Logout,Register,user authentication and authorization using the jsonwebtoken.I used Mongodb database to store the data of registered users

API-URL : https://transition-computing-backend-assignment.onrender.com/api/v1/register Method:POST User Registeration : while user registeration the user has to give input of name,email,password,but in schema I have mentioned the role key an by default it is "user". ----The email is verified by providing some string to validate,if email is invalid it gives an error message of invalid email "please provide valid email" ----Before storing the user data into the database, I have filtered weather the eamil is exist in the database or not.If email is present in database it gives the message "Email alredy exist pls login" ---The password is hashed using the bcrypt and the password is saved securly.
Api-Url:https://transition-computing-backend-assignment.onrender.com/api/v1/login Method:POST User Login : The user has to provide to provid the email and password. ----The password is compared using bcrypt.compare method, if the password is incorrect it says invalid credientials provided. ----If the user is logged in successfuly,It shows the user is logged in successfully. ---I have used jsonwebtoken ,the token is generated when the user is successfully loged in and that token is stored in cookies. ----The cookie name i have used in this project is "jwtoken" ---while using jsonwebtoken in jwt.sign method i have stored the user _id as userId and this is used to retrive the user data ---The cookie will expires in 1day and the jwtoken will expires in 1day
